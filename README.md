# ToonTanks

This is a simple 3D game in which you control a tank and try to destroy the towers before they destroy you. 
Use WASD keys to move, the mouse to turn, and the space bar to shoot. The towers also shoot projectiles at you once you're in range.

You can download and play the game from [here](https://iltenahmet.itch.io/toontanks).

I've made this game as a part of an [Unreal Engine C++ course](https://www.udemy.com/course/unrealcourse/) on Udemy. 
For the most part, I've followed the instructions of the course but I've made some changes along the way. 
For example, in the course, A and D keys turn the tank while in my version A and D keys move 
the tank sideways and the tank turns based on the location of the mouse.

Most of the functionality of the game is written in C++ with some usage of the Blueprint system.
In the future, I plan on adding more levels to make the game progressively harder and add health bars above the towers and the tank.
